# Social Movie Network

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the idea for an application that allows people to rate and compare movies amongst their friends. 

An application such as this meets several user needs:
- The desire to share opinions about movies an individual has seen
- The ability to receive recommendations and learn about movies that you haven't heard about
- The opportunity to discuss and debate preferences amongst a group of people whose opinions you trust, or at least somewhat understand.

## Background
Although you can rank movies on sites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB, your ratings are aggregated along with the entire popilation of randys. A non-anonymous, disaggregated movie rating system is better for understanding and judging people's tastes.

This concept was first made about three years ago in a janky spreadsheet that you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18TzvHVjgGEQGgslIjTUAspLa8P1vNDXSphaOXqbnz2I/edit#gid=767262298).

## Technical Overview
These are the elements required for the movie rating system.

### A way to rate movies
A user needs to be able to rate movies that are assoicated with their individual "account". In lieu of creating an account, perhaps they can have a unique hash that they enter?

Other nice to haves:
- movie name autocomplete
- an "inbox" of movies to rate based on movies other people have rated (the system doesn't work as well if everyone is rating disparte movies)

### A table of some sort to aggregate everyone's rating
A way to see average movie ratings. Possibly a way to sort and filter based on genre, controverisal movies, etc.

### Some sort of way to explore affinity between you and other users in the community

See who likes the same movies you do. See who likes movies you hate!

## Use Cases
Although the suggested example is for movies, this concept could be used for other things that involve subjective "tastes", ie. restaurants, books.. uh.. music?
